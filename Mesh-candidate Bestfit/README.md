You can generate a large scale of diverse data for pretraining applying our proposed method Mesh-candidate Bestfit, just follow steps below:

### 1. Environment Setup

You need to install [PyMuPDF](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/1.23.7/) for subsequent rendering via pip:

```bash
cd "Mesh-candidate Bestfit"
pip install pymupdf==1.23.7
```

### 2. Preprocessing

Two primary things need to be well prepared before starting generation: 

1. Original annotation file of your dataset

   - It must be a json following COCO format.
   - Each instance has a unique instance id.
   - It should be placed under `./` folder

2. Element Pool

You can easily extract elements of different categories based on the original annotation file. However, it is required to be structured like this (taking M6Doc dataset as an example):

```bash
./element_pool
├── advertisement
│   ├── 727.jpg
│   ├── 919.jpg
│   ├── 1423.jpg
│   └── ...
├── algorithm
│   ├── 12653.jpg
│   ├── 17485.jpg
│   ├── 44364.jpg
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

The first-level subdirectories are named after the specific categories, and the elements inside are named with corresponding instance ids in the raw json file of the dataset. 

**Note:** For convenience, we provide original annotation file and element pool for M6Doc dataset, which can be downloaded from [M6Doc annotation file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ua41Gs3UW8iuoJp21tZ4-lczVrcEm-gP/view?usp=sharing) and [M6Doc element pool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MrIFObKr1bDGgZLBQM_c_Dvobkp6mjFE/view?usp=sharing), respectively.

### 3. Data Augmentation(Optional)

If you want to apply our designed augmentation pipeline to your element pool, you can just run:

```bash
python augmentation.py --min_count 100 --aug_times 50
```

The script will perform augmentation pipeline `aug_times` times on each element of categories whose element number is less than `min_count`.

### 4. Map Dict

To facilitate the random selection of candidates during the rendering phase, it is necessary to establish a mapping from elements to all of their candidate paths:

```bash
python map_dict.py --save_path ./map_dict.json --use_aug
```

### 5. Layout Generation

Now, you can generate diverse layouts using Mesh-candidate Bestfit algorithm. To prevent process blocking, it will save the result of each layout in a timely manner, but you can use the [combine_layouts.py](./combine_layouts.py) script to combine them all together like this:

```bash
python bestfit_generator.py --generate_num 10000 --json_path ./M6Doc.json --output_dir ./generated_layouts/seperate
python combine_layouts.py --seperate_layouts_dir ./generate_layouts/seperate --save_path ./generate_layouts/combined_layouts.json
```

Afterwards, feel free to delete the seperate layouts since they are no longer used.

### 6. Rendering

Finally, you can render generated layouts and save the results in yolo format via the script below:

```bash
python rendering.py --json_path ./generate_layouts/combined_layouts.json --map_dict_path ./map_dict.json --save_dir ./generated_dataset 
```

### Visualization

We provide [visualize.ipynb](./visualize.ipynb) to visualize the layouts generated by our proposed methods.
